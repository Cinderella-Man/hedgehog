# This file is responsible for configuring your umbrella
# and **all applications** and their dependencies with the

# Note that all applications in your umbrella share the
# same configuration and dependencies, which is why they
# all use the same configuration file. If you want different
# configurations or dependencies per app, it is best to
# move said applications out of the umbrella.
